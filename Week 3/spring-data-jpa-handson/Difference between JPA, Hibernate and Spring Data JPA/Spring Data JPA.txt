What it is:
Spring Data JPA is a Spring project that builds on top of JPA to simplify database access in Java applications.

What it does:
It provides helpful abstractions that reduce boilerplate code:
 Automatically generates repository implementations at runtime
 Introduces JpaRepository, CrudRepository, and other base interfaces
 Supports query methods using naming conventions (e.g., findByEmail, findByAuthorAndTitle)

How it works:
Spring Data JPA acts as a layer over JPA and delegates the actual persistence logic to a JPA provider like Hibernate. You define the structure, and Spring wires up the implementation behind the scenes.
