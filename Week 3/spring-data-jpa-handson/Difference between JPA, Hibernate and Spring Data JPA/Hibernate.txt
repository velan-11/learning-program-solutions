What it is: Hibernate is a widely used implementation of the Java Persistence API (JPA). While JPA defines the standard for object-relational mapping (ORM) in Java, Hibernate provides the actual working code that fulfills this specification

What it does: Provides the actual code to persist, query, and manage entities. It can be used with or without JPA.

Extra features: Adds features beyond JPA, like:

Better caching

Native APIs (Session, Criteria)

Extra query options (HQL, native SQL)

How itâ€™s used: When you use JPA in Spring Boot, Hibernate is often the default JPA provider under the hood.
