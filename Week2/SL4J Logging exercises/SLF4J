SLF4J:
SLF4J stands for Simple Logging Facade for Java.

What It Does?
SLF4J is not a logging implementation itself — its a common API that allows you 
to plug in any logging backend like:

Logging Framework	            Description
Logback	                      SLF4J’s recommended backend
Log4j	                        A popular logging framework
java.util.logging           	Built-in Java logging
TinyLog,SimpleLogger,etc. 	  Other supported backends


-Decouples logging API from logging implementation
-Cleaner, consistent logging interface
-Easy to switch logging libraries without changing your code
